language for clarity and tone. This process is often manual, repetitive, and prone to delays
due to multiple review cycles. There is potential to leverage AI to streamline this process by creating an AI tool which supports the review of board papers based on the guidelines provided by the
Governance Board leveraging AI-powered tools (e.g., summarisation models, and compliance
checkers) to automate key steps in the review process. AI can assist by:
Ensuring adherence to governance templates and tone guidelines.
Providing real-time suggestions for clarity, consistency, and compliance."	"Improved Consistency and Quality with uniform language tone and structure across all
governance papers
Reduced review time and number of revisions required for board papers
Insights from past papers incorporated into future papers"	Rowena White	Future Hub	Microsoft Foundry	Restricted	Selected Staff in Secretary's Department	Proof of concept	Under review
55	23/12/2025	Structured Evaluations on SmartConnect test outputs	Business-specific	SmartConnect’s current network and security testing is manual, isolated, and lacks centralized visibility, making Zscaler policy validation across multiple protocols slow and inefficient. The absence of structured reporting and trend analysis hinders compliance and risk management feedback loops. The proposed solution leverages Microsoft Foundry Bronze Hub to run structured evaluations on SmartConnect test outputs. Cucumber results will be exported as JSONL, uploaded to Foundry, and used to trigger Cloud Evaluation runs that generate dashboards for pass/fail rates, latency, and protocol coverage. This proof of concept demonstrates feasibility for centralized observability and sets the stage for future automation using Foundry Agents.	"Centralized dashboards in Microsoft Foundry for test outcomes and performance trends.
Enhanced observability of protocol enforcement without the need to build custom reporting tools.
Foundation for future automation, such as Foundry Agents for reporting and drift detection, without requiring CI/CD initially."	Dmitriy Yarkov	Strategy and Change	Microsoft Foundry	Restricted	Dmitriy Yarkov	Proof of concept	Approved
56	29/12/2025	LLM assisted document generation for NPP code refresh	Business-specific	BK is refreshing NPP code under the A2A program and would like to leverage AI to document IBM ACE code, including inputs, outputs, logic, and dependencies. This approach will speed up story creation, improve developer understanding, and ensure comprehensive test coverage. Overall, it is expected to cut effort by 20–30% across development, analysis, and testing.	• Accelerates story creation and reduces planning time• Improves developer understanding of complex code• Ensures complete test coverage, including edge cases• Cuts overall effort by 20–30% across Dev, BA, and testing	Vivek Maheshwari	Information Technology	Microsoft Foundry	Restricted	Vivek Maheshwari, Kala Sriram, Har Roshan	Proof of concept	Under review
57	9/01/2026	Accelerating Penetration Testing with AI Micro‑Agents	Business-specific	Current penetration testing at RBA is slow, manual, and inconsistent, consuming up to 35% of engagement time on repetitive tasks. We propose a secure Proof of Concept using AI micro‑agents in Foundry Bronze to automate busywork, standardise outputs, and accelerate delivery, while maintaining strict governance, security, and human oversight.	• Cut busywork: AI cleans/redacts sensitive details, organises notes, and drafts findings—saving ~40–60% of admin time.• Faster recon/OSINT: AI gathers, de‑duplicates, and summarises data—~30–50% quicker.• Consistent outputs: Standardised prompts and templates ensure clear, uniform findings.• Better early coverage: AI surfaces likely issues earlier—improving detection by ~20–30%.• Quicker reports: Drafts ready sooner—cutting report writing time by ~50%.• Safe by design: All work stays in Foundry Bronze with logging and human approvals.• Higher throughput: Deliver ~15–25% more engagements per quarter.• Reusable knowledge: Shared prompt library speeds onboarding and reduces one‑off effort.

58	22/01/2026	Interactive AI Tool based on current RITS Information facility	Business-specific	Accessing information in the RITS Information Facility is currently slow, manual and time‑consuming. The proposal introduces an interactive AI tool that allows users to ask questions and instantly retrieve the relevant RITS information. By streamlining navigation of a publicly accessible knowledge base, the tool aims to improve efficiency for internal teams and industry participants, while reinforcing the RBA’s position as an early and responsible adopter of AI in the public sector.	"• Faster, easier access to RITS information through natural‑language queries.
• Reduces manual searching and improves productivity for internal and external users
• Public information source means minimal data‑related risks.
• Strengthens the Bank’s reputation as an early and meaningful adopter of AI."	Rohit Dudeja	Payments Settlements	Microsoft Foundry	Public	TBC	Proof of concept	Under review
59	22/01/2026	Travel Management - Scout	Business-specific	CTM Scout is an AI‑enabled travel assistant that helps staff manage bookings quickly and easily within the CTM travel portal. It supports checking itineraries, issuing tickets, cancelling trips, and chatting directly with a travel consultant, all through a simple interface. The service uses secure, private AI models hosted in Australia and does not train on client or CTM data. With strong governance controls, remote shutdown capability, and no PII ingestion, Scout offers a safe, efficient solution to improve the staff travel experience	"• Easy‑to‑use interface for staff travellers.
• Instant responses to travel queries and booking checks.
• Ability to issue tickets or cancel trips within seconds.
• Fast processing of refunds or conversion to credit
• Secure AI environment with no use of client or CTM data for model training"	Deepa Benjamin	Information Technology	CTM Scout	Public	All Staff	Production 	Under review
60	27/01/2026	Lexis Nexis AI for legal research	Business-specific	The Legal section plans to trial Lexis+ AI, an AI‑powered legal research tool integrated within the existing LexisNexis platform. The tool is designed to speed up research, surface relevant case law, and provide concise summaries using authoritative, curated legal sources. Because it draws only from trusted LexisNexis content, it reduces the risk of hallucinations common in general‑purpose AI tools. The four‑week trial aims to assess whether the tool can meaningfully improve research productivity while maintaining accuracy and professional standards.	• Faster access to relevant case law and commentary.• More consistent, high‑quality summaries based on authoritative sources.• Reduced manual effort, freeing time for higher‑value legal analysis.• Lower risk of AI inaccuracies due to use of curated LexisNexis content.• Helps the team compare outputs against Copilot and current manual research methods.
