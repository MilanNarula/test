Perfect — thanks for sharing your draft. I can build this into a **fully-implementable AI Policy for the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA)**, drawing upon:  
- **Australian Government AI Ethics Principles** (transparency, accountability, fairness, privacy, contestability, human oversight, etc.)  
- **Global frameworks (OECD AI Principles, EU AI Act guidance)**  
- **Gartner recommendations** on AI governance (guardrails, accountability structures, transparent risk management)  

I’ll keep your structure, but expand and refine each section so it’s “practical, enforceable, and future-proof.”

- AI must **not replace professional judgment** — all AI outputs are to be reviewed and validated by staff.  
- AI use must align with the **Bank’s Code of Conduct**, **Privacy Act 1988**, APRA prudential standards, cybersecurity guidelines, and applicable legislation.  
- AI must be governed by the principles of:  
  - **Transparency**: activities open to internal and external scrutiny

## **2. Purpose**  
The purpose of this Policy is to:  
- Establish a **responsible and ethical framework** for AI adoption across the RBA.  
- Ensure AI use is consistent with the Bank’s mandates — safeguarding monetary stability, employment, systemic integrity, public trust, and efficient national payments systems.  
- Minimise **operational, reputational, and legal risks**.  
- Support staff in confidently and appropriately using AI in their work.  
- Facilitate **safe experimentation with emerging AI tools** while ensuring compliance with laws, prudential responsibilities, and ethical standards.

- Applies to:  
  - All RBA staff, contractors, and consultants accessing Bank-approved AI tools.  
  - Third parties providing AI-related services under RBA contracts or partnership agreements.  
- Exceptions: AI model development in **sandbox or research environments** may be permitted with explicit approval from the **Chief Data & Analytics Officer (CDAO)** and subject to safeguards.

## **4. Compliance**  
- Breaches of this Policy will be reviewed under the **RBA Code of Conduct** and may result in disciplinary action including dismissal.  
- Non-compliance, particularly in relation to misuse of **sensitive, financial, or prudential datasets**, may trigger legal or regulatory action under the **Privacy Act 1988**, APRA CPS 234, or Commonwealth law.  
- Suppliers and contractors must comply with this Policy as a binding condition of engagement.

## **5. Policy Objectives**  
This AI Policy seeks to:  
- Ensure **responsible, ethical, and lawful use of AI** across all RBA functions.  
- Safeguard the integrity, confidentiality, and accuracy of data.  
- Provide a consistent framework for **assessment of AI risks and opportunities**.  
- Encourage **innovation and efficiency** while maintaining prudential controls.

## **6. Policy Components**  
The AI Policy is implemented through the following components:  

1. **Risk Assessment and Approval**  
   - All AI applications must undergo an **AI Risk Assessment (AIRA)** considering ethics, bias, security, and compliance.  
   - High-risk AI uses (e.g., financial forecasting, fraud detection) require approval by the **AI Governance Committee**.  

2. **Data Protection**  
   - Only authorised datasets stored in Bank systems may be used in AI models.  
   - Prohibition of AI training on personal, confidential, or market-sensitive data unless permitted by legal and data governance frameworks.  

3. **Human Oversight**  
   - AI is a **supportive tool**; staff retain **full accountability** for all decisions.  
   - Automated decision-making systems must include **human-in-the-loop review checkpoints**.  

4. **Transparency and Explainability**  
   - AI outputs must be explainable and — where possible — auditable.  
   - Staff must be able to justify insights derived from AI tools.  

5. **Security and Resilience**  
   - AI models must comply with the **RBA Cybersecurity Policy** and APRA prudential standards (e.g., CPS 234).  
   - Vendors must demonstrate compliance with ISO/IEC AI security standards.  

6. **Bias and Fairness**  
   - Regular testing for **algorithmic bias** must be conducted.  
   - AI solutions used in HR, recruitment, or customer interactions must satisfy fairness criteria.  

7. **Vendor and Third-Party Governance**  
   - Any external AI tool must be vetted through RBA’s **technology due diligence** process.  
   - Contracts must include clauses requiring AI systems to align with **ethical and legal standards**.

✅ This draft is **structured, enforceable, and aligned with both Australian and international standards**, while giving clear guardrails for staff use of AI.  

Would you like me to also create a **“Procedures Document” companion** (laying out the AI Risk Assessment Process, approval workflow, and staff usage guidelines), so you have both **policy** and **implementation playbook**?
